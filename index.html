			<h5>Why Durham House of Pets?</h5>
			<p>
				The Durham House of Pets is dedicated to providing what your pet needs. From chew toys to sweaters for your snake, DHOP is the place for your pet! Located in beautiful Durham, New Hampshire, our employees are straight out of the University of New Hampshire Animal Care Program. We hire the best students to gain hands on experience with animals and further their passion for animals. Not only do we have the best employees, but we also have the most extensive care program for pets in New England. Does your snake need a sweater? Find snake sweaters here! Does your cat need his/her claws trimmed? Find pet nail trimmers here! If you can think it for your pet, we have it!

			<h5>History of Durham House Of Pets</h5>
			<p>
				Established in 2006 by our current President and Owner Tessa Selma, DHOP was started with the dream of having all of the town or Durham's Pet's needs. By starting with dogs, Tessa slowly built her business up and expanded into other animals like cats, and eventually began stocking products for other animals like snakes. The team has slowly grown over the years, and now we are proud to present overnight shipping for items ordered online!
